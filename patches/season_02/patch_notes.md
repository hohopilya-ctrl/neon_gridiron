# Season 02: Prism Rivalry Patch Notes

## The Age of Strategy
Season 02 introduces the **Counter Matrix**, allowing teams to build defensive and offensive metas through tactical ability selection.

### 1. New Mechanics
- **Ability Selection**: Agents now control two active skills (**Neon Rush** and **Glitch Shield**). The AI select channel (Channel 4) determines which skill is primed for the next trigger.
- **Glitch Shield (ABL_025)**: 
  - Activating the shield grants a cyan glow and mitigates **50% of incoming foul penalties**. 
  - Cooldown: 10.0s.
- **Reaction Variance**: Observation precision now depends on the **Reactive** (ATR_06) attribute. Lower reactivity increases sensor noise.

### 2. Balance Adjustments
- **Neon Rush (ABL_001)**: Cooldown remains at 6.0s but now categorized as "Mobility" for future counter-tracking.
- **Collision Damage**: Penalty points for high-speed collisions reduced by 15% when target is shielded.
