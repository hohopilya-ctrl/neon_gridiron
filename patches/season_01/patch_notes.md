# Season 01: Neon Genesis Patch Notes

## Meta Shift: The Core Foundation
Welcome to the inaugural season of Neon Gridiron. This patch establishes the baseline for all evolutionary AI development.

### 1. Balance Changes
- **Neon Rush (ABL_001)**: 
  - Cooldown increased from `5.0s` to `6.0s`. 
  - *Dev Note: Dashing was slightly too frequent, leading to chaotic clumping.*
- **Stamina Regeneration**: 
  - Base recovery rate increased by `10%`. 
  - *Dev Note: This allows players with lower "Cooling" attributes to stay in the play longer.*

### 2. Attribute System V1
- Players now have randomized potential in **Agility**, **Impact**, and **Cooling**.
- **Agility**: Affects top speed and acceleration.
- **Impact**: Increases kick force and collision resistance.
- **Cooling**: Reduces ability cooldown time.

### 3. Rule Adjustments
- **Spectacle-based Rewards**: The reward function now factors in spectacle-score triggers (Saves, Shots). 
- **Ref Sanctions**: Penalty points now decay at a rate of 0.1/sec.
