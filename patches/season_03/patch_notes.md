# Season 03: Hyper League Patch Notes

## The Spectacle Era
Season 03 shifts the meta towards high-octane, entertaining gameplay. The AI is now rewarded not just for winning, but for how it wins.

### 1. New Mechanics
- **Spectacle Bonus**: Training rewards now include a multiplier for "Spectacle Score" events (Aerial Passes, Last-Second Saves, Long Shots).
- **Expected Goals (xG)**: The simulation now calculates xG in real-time. High xG shots that are saved grant massive Spectacle points.
- **TV-Ready Physics**: Air drag slightly reduced to allow for faster, more dynamic ball movement.

### 2. Balance Overrides
- **Glitch Shield (ABL_025)**: Radius increased by 10% to improve defensive presence.
- **Stamina Regen**: Bonus increased from 1.1x to 1.2x to support high-intensity pressing.

*Goal: Maximum viewer engagement and highlight-reel moments.*
